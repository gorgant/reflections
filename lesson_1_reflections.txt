    isolated the areas that were changed, so less text to scan

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can revisit previous learnings and avoid previous pitfalls
    you can borrow code from earlier versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is broken up into logical chunks that are easy to go back to and interpret

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programs have many inter-related files that need to be changed simultaneously

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log pulls up the commit history.  Git diff compares two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You have the security of always reverting a pervious version that works

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
