When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your repository with someone else, or access it remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    An automatic push could publicly post changes that aren't ready to be public

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone replicates a repository but does not include any attribution.  Fork is similar to clone but it includes attribution. Branches are simply iterations within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	Allows you to compare your current local environment to the most recent pull of the remote environment

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be difficult to ensure we are working on the most recent version of files.  We would not be able to work very well simultaneously.  It could be faster though b/c less operations to complete. But it would be a mess.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
